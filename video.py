 <p>00:00: Hi. This video showcases how CirAI simplifies the analysis of Analog and RF circuits by converting images or netlists into interactive mathematical models. You will see how to upload circuit data, configure analysis parameters, and receive AI-driven performance advice to optimize your designs.</p>
 <p>00:18: The left column is the input. you can insert image file or a netlist file.</p>
 <p>00:23: Click browse files to select your circuit image or netlist from your device.</p>
 <p>00:28: Enter the path to your circuit image file to upload it for analysis.</p>
 <p>00:33: insert here your function to analyze (for example: "V-out to V-in", Z of V-out, etc.):" to specify the function you want to analyze.</p>
 <p>00:42: Click show derivation steps in markdown format to display the step by step, mathematical derivation of the analysis.</p>
 <p>00:49: Click go to initiate, the circuit analysis based on the provided inputs and parameters.</p>
 <p>00:55: Verify the formula below matches your circuit diagram." to confirm the derived formula corresponds to your design.</p>
 <p>01:03: "Edit Freely:" to modify the derived formula manually if needed for custom adjustments.</p>
 <p>01:09: "Complex Mode": For S-domain (s=jω), go to Settings (Wrench) → Enable 'Complex Mode'." to analyze circuits in the complex frequency domain.</p>
 <p>01:19: Click here to enable "complex mode", and explore more configuration options available in the interface.</p>
 <p>01:26: Click here to enable "complex mode".</p>
 <p>01:29: Click all to select all available, parameters for comprehensive analysis.</p>
 <p>01:34: Here you can freely use this calculator, as a Desmos graphic calculator. You can write any expression of the function and analyze it on the graph. For example, real HS.</p>
 <p>01:44: For more details on it, visit desmos.com.</p>
 <p>01:48: Click GMS equals 1 to set the transconductance parameter to 1 for the analysis.</p>
 <p>01:54: Click "Expression 5: L equals 1 p" to set the inductance parameter to 1 pico henry.</p>
 <p>02:00: Click here to access controls for adjusting circuit parameters.</p>
 <p>02:04: if you want a specific parameter to be a slider, delete him and generate him again</p>
 <p>02:09: You can calculate the phase by writing the expressions "arctan imagH(s) realH(s)" to analyze the phase angle of the transfer function.</p>
 <p>02:18: Click here to open additional settings for the circuit analysis.</p>
 <p>02:22: Click logarithmic to display results on a logarithmic scale for better visualization.</p>
 <p>02:27: Click linear to switch, the display to a linear scale format.</p>
 <p>02:31: Go here to move to the next section of the circuit analysis interface. This is an Analog chatbot assistant. he have all the information you inserted to the simulation. he can answer a questions, make optimization and so o</p>
 <p>02:44: Use this text box to explain your use of the circuit. The AI ​​will help you improve the architecture, suggest typical sizes, perform optimizations, warn you about circuit hazards, and give you articles to read on the topic.</p>
 <p>02:57: Click AI circuit advisor to access AI driven performance advice for your circuit design.</p>
 <p>03:04: Here you can see an example: Performance, power, noise, components and recommended articles to read</p>
 <p>03:11: Click "Ask a question" to input queries about your circuit's performance or design improvements.</p>
 <p>03:16: Click keyboard Double Arrow left to navigate to the previous section or data point in the interface.</p>
 <p>03:22: Click keyboard Double Arrow right to move to the next section or data point in the analysis.</p>
 <p>03:37: Click here to submit your question to the AI circuit advisor for analysis and feedback.</p>
 <p>03:43: After few seconds, the assistant will write the answer in the same place.</p>
 <p>03:47: This videodemonstrated how to use CirAI to analyze Analog and RF circuits by uploading circuit images, configuring analysis parameters, and leveraging AI-driven advice to optimize your designs. You can now confidently apply these features to streamline your circuit evaluation process and improve performance. Thanks for watching and good luck.</p>
